# üå±Camunda Carbon Reductor

The Camunda Carbon Reductor allows you to time shift your processes' carbon emissions when energy is clean while still fulfilling the requested SLAs.

Technically, it's implemented as a Camunda [Connector](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/connectors/introduction-to-connectors/) for Camunda Platform 8 and as an [External Task Worker](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/external-tasks/) for Camunda Platform 7.

# ‚ú®Features

The Carbon Reductor Connector consists of an element-template that can be used in the process
model that connects to the connector function.

## Time Shifting Mode ‚è≠Ô∏è

Using the time shifting mode (default) the Carbon Reductor Connector allows you to
optimize for lower carbon emissions by moving your process execution into a timeframe with the least amount 
of carbon possible while still fulfilling SLAs.

The Carbon Reductor Connector defines the following inputs:

- the location where the worker are running (e.g. Germany, UK, France, USA, etc.)
- a milestone (a timestamp used to calculate the duration the process instance has been running)
- a duration for the remainder of the process (the duration the remainder needs at most)
- the maximum duration a process instance can take

## Measuring Mode üìè

> *Note*: This mode only works with the [Carbon Aware SDK](./api-carbon-aware/README.md) API at the moment.

Using the measuring mode the Carbon Reductor Connector allows you to measure the emissions in gCO2e/KWh at 
execution time and reports as well the emissions at the optimal time while still fulfilling your SLAs.

The same input as in the [Time Shifting Mode ‚è≠Ô∏è](#time-shifting-mode-) is required.

# üöÄGetting Started

We provide the Carbon Reductor for Camunda Platform 7 and 8:

## Camunda 8

To start the Camunda 8 Connector have a look at the specific [README](./camunda-carbon-reductor-c8/README.md).

## Camunda 7

To start the Camunda 7 External Task Worker have a look at the specific [README](./camunda-carbon-reductor-c7/README.md).

# üìàReporting Carbon Reduction via Camunda Optimize

Since Camunda Carbon Reductor stores the carbon savings as process variables, 
we have the ability to visualize our successes in [Camunda Optimize](https://camunda.com/de/platform/optimize/).

For the [CarbonHack22](https://taikai.network/gsf/hackathons/carbonhack22/projects/cl9czuvwy65500401uzm9hfwbs9/idea) 
we visualized the results for out example process and it looks like the following:

# üìöReleases

The list of [releases](https://github.com/envite-consulting/camunda-carbon-reductor/releases) contains a detailed changelog.

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

The following compatibility matrix shows the officially supported Camunda versions for each release.
Other combinations might also work but have not been tested.
