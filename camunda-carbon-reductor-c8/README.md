# 🗒️Notes

Right now it's kind of a job-worker-connector, due to the fact we need
to delay it with the `retryBackoff`.

`TODO`: Migrate to the "real" Camunda 8 [Connector](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/connectors/custom-built-connectors/connector-sdk/) if 
it provides the functionality to allow delaying the execution.

# 🚀Getting Started

Read the [Getting Started Guide](../README.md#getting-started) in the parent README.
